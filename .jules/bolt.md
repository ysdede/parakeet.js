## 2024-05-22 - JS Loops vs TypedArray.set
Learning: Manual loops over TypedArrays in V8 are significantly slower (~10x) than `set` + `subarray` for bulk copies, even for moderate sizes (D=640).
Action: Prefer `set` + `subarray` for contiguous memory copies in hot loops.

## 2024-11-20 - Unrolling Float32Array argmax
Learning: When finding the maximum value (argmax) in a large typed array like `Float32Array`, unrolling the loop 8x is significantly faster than using a simple `for` loop, yielding a ~2x performance speedup in the hot path.
Action: Apply loop unrolling for max reductions in high-frequency typed array operations.
