# Parakeet.js  

Client-side ONNX inference of NVIDIA *Parakeet* speech-to-text models.
Runs entirely in the browser on **WebGPU** or **WASM** via
[ONNX Runtime Web](https://onnxruntime.ai/).

> **Parakeet.js** offers a high-performance, browser-first implementation for NVIDIA's Parakeet-TDT speech-to-text models, running entirely client-side via WebGPU and WASM. Powered by ONNX Runtime Web, this library makes it simple to integrate state-of-the-art transcription into any web application.

> **Status:** Early preview – API is subject to change while things stabilise.
> **Note:** Currently only supports the Parakeet-TDT model architecture.

## Installation

```bash
# npm
npm i parakeet.js onnxruntime-web

# yarn
yarn add parakeet.js onnxruntime-web
```

`onnxruntime-web` is a peer-dependency that supplies the runtime back-ends (WebGPU, WASM).

## Model assets

We host ready-to-use ONNX exports on the HuggingFace Hub:

```
istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-onnx
```

The helper `getParakeetModel()` downloads all required files and caches them in **IndexedDB**:

```js
import { getParakeetModel } from 'parakeet.js';

const repoId = 'istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-onnx';
const { urls, filenames } = await getParakeetModel(repoId, {
  backend: 'webgpu', // 'webgpu' or 'wasm'
  encoderQuant: 'fp32',    // 'fp32' or 'int8'
  decoderQuant: 'int8',    // 'fp32' or 'int8'
  preprocessor: 'nemo128',
  progress: ({file,loaded,total}) => console.log(file, loaded/total)
});
```

Returned structure:

```ts
{
  urls: {
    encoderUrl: string,
    decoderUrl: string,
    encoderDataUrl?: string | null,
    decoderDataUrl?: string | null,
    tokenizerUrl: string,
    preprocessorUrl: string
  },
  filenames: { encoder: string; decoder: string }
}
```

## Creating a model instance

```js
import { ParakeetModel } from 'parakeet.js';

const model = await ParakeetModel.fromUrls({
  ...urls,                 // spread the URLs returned above
  filenames,               // needed for external .data mapping
  backend: 'webgpu',       // 'webgpu' or 'wasm'
  cpuThreads: 6,           // For WASM backend
  verbose: false,          // ORT verbose logging
});
```

### Back-end presets

The library supports two primary backends: `webgpu` and `wasm`.

- **`webgpu` (Default):** This is the fastest option for modern desktop browsers. It runs in a hybrid configuration:
  - The heavy **encoder** model runs on the **GPU** (WebGPU) for maximum throughput.
  - The **decoder** model runs on the **CPU** (WASM). The decoder's architecture contains operations not fully supported by the ONNX Runtime WebGPU backend, causing it to fall back to WASM anyway. This configuration makes the behavior explicit and stable, avoiding performance issues and warnings.
  - In this mode, the encoder must be `fp32`, but you can choose `fp32` or `int8` for the decoder.

- **`wasm`:** Both encoder and decoder run on the CPU. This is best for compatibility with older devices or environments without WebGPU support. Both models can be `fp32` or `int8`.

## Transcribing audio

```js
// 16-kHz mono PCM Float32Array
await model.transcribe(pcmFloat32, 16_000, {
  returnTimestamps: true,
  returnConfidences: true,
  frameStride: 2,      // 1 (default) = highest accuracy / 2-4 faster
});
```

Extra options:

| Option | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| `temperature` | 1.0 | Softmax temperature for decoding (1.0 = greedy, >1.0 = sampling) |
| `frameStride` | 1 | Advance decoder by *n* encoder frames per step |

### Result schema

```ts
{
  utterance_text: string,
  words: Array<{text,start_time,end_time,confidence}>,
  tokens: Array<{token,start_time,end_time,confidence}>,
  confidence_scores: { overall_log_prob, word_avg, token_avg },
  metrics: {
    rtf: number,
    total_ms: number,
    preprocess_ms: number,
    encode_ms: number,
    decode_ms: number,
    tokenize_ms: number
  },
  is_final: true
}
```

## Warm-up & Verification (Recommended)

The first time you run inference after loading a model, the underlying runtime needs to compile the execution graph. This makes the first run significantly slower. To ensure a smooth user experience, it's best practice to perform a "warm-up" run with a dummy or known audio sample immediately after model creation.

Our React demo does this and also verifies the output to ensure the model loaded correctly.

```js
// In your app, after `ParakeetModel.fromUrls()` succeeds:
setStatus('Warming up & verifying…');

const audioRes = await fetch('/assets/known_audio.wav');
const pcm = await decodeAudio(audioRes); // Your audio decoding logic
const { utterance_text } = await model.transcribe(pcm, 16000);

const expected = 'the known transcript for your audio';
if (utterance_text.toLowerCase().includes(expected)) {
  setStatus('Model ready ✔');
} else {
  setStatus('Model verification failed!');
}
```

## Runtime tuning knobs

| Property | Where | Effect |
|----------|-------|--------|
| `cpuThreads` | `fromUrls()` | Sets `ort.env.wasm.numThreads`; pick *cores-2* for best balance |
| `encoderQuant` | `getParakeetModel()` | Selects `fp32` or `int8` model for the encoder. |
| `decoderQuant` | `getParakeetModel()` | Selects `fp32` or `int8` model for the decoder. |
| `frameStride` | `transcribe()` | Trade-off latency vs accuracy |
| `enableProfiling` | `fromUrls()` | Enables ORT profiler (JSON written to `/tmp/profile_*.json`) |

## Using the React demo as a template

Located at `examples/react-demo`.

Quick start:

```bash
cd examples/react-demo
npm i
npm run dev  # Vite => http://localhost:5173
```

Key components:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App.jsx` | Complete end-to-end reference UI. Shows how to load a model with progress bars, perform a warm-up/verification step, display performance metrics (RTF, timings), and manage transcription history. |
| `parakeet.js` | Library entry; houses the model wrapper and performance instrumentation. |
| `hub.js` | Lightweight HuggingFace Hub helper – downloads and caches model binaries. |

Copy-paste the `loadModel()` and `transcribeFile()` functions into your app, adjust UI bindings, and you are ready to go.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| `Some nodes were not assigned...` warning | When using the `webgpu` backend, ORT assigns minor operations (`Shape`, `Gather`, etc.) in the encoder to the CPU for efficiency. | This is expected and harmless. The heavy-lifting is still on the GPU. |
| GPU memory still ~2.4 GB with INT8 selected | In WebGPU mode, the encoder must be `fp32`. The `int8` option only applies to the WASM backend or the decoder in hybrid mode. | This is the expected behavior for the `webgpu` backend. |
| `Graph capture feature not available` error | Mixed EPs (CPU/GPU) or unsupported ops prevent GPU graph capture. | The library automatically retries without capture; safe to ignore. |

## Credits

This project builds upon the excellent work of:

- **[istupakov](https://github.com/istupakov)** - For providing the [ONNX-ASR](https://github.com/istupakov/onnx-asr) repository, which served as the foundation and starting point for this JavaScript implementation
- **[istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-onnx](https://huggingface.co/istupakov/parakeet-tdt-0.6b-v2-onnx)** - For the ONNX model exports and preprocessor implementations that made this library possible.
- **ONNX Runtime Web** - For powering the browser-based inference engine
- **ONNX Runtime Node** - For enabling high-performance server-side inference

The Python-based ONNX-ASR project provided crucial insights into model handling, preprocessing pipelines, and served as a reference implementation during the development of this browser-compatible version.

Happy hacking! 🎉
