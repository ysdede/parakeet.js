## @Seyhan - Your Next Task: Story 1.5 Energy-Based Pre-VAD

**Branch:** Create `feature/energy-vad` from `feature/v2-rewrite`

**Requirements (from epics.md):**
- Implement `EnergyVAD` class in `src/lib/vad/`
- RMS energy calculation on audio chunks
- Configurable threshold (default: 0.01)
- Minimum speech duration filtering (100ms)
- Minimum silence duration (300ms)
- Returns `VADResult { isSpeech, energy, timestamp }`

**Interface:**
```typescript
interface EnergyVADConfig {
  energyThreshold: number;    // 0.01
  minSpeechDuration: number;  // 100ms
  minSilenceDuration: number; // 300ms
}
```

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Energy calculation accurate to ±5%
- [ ] Filters transient sounds < minSpeechDuration
- [ ] Speech segments properly delimited
- [ ] Config values adjustable at runtime
